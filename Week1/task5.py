# Task 5
# Write a program which will ask for two numbers from a user.

questionA = input("Enter first number:")
questionB = input("Enter second number:")

# questionC = input("Enter first number:")
# questionD = input("Enter second number:")

# questionE = input("Enter first number:")
# questionF = input("Enter second number:")


sum = int(questionA)+int(questionB)
# sum = int(questionC)*int(questionD)
# sum = int(questionE)/int(questionF)

print('sum 0f {0} and {1} is {2} '. format(questionA, questionB, sum))
# print('sum 0f {0} and {1} is {2} '. format(questionC, questionD, sum))
# print('sum 0f {0} and {1} is {2} '. format(questionE, questionF, sum))
# Then offer a menu to the user giving them a choice of operator: e.g. –Enter “a” if you want to add“b” if you want to subtractInclude +, -, /, *, ** square (to the power of). Once the user has selected which operator they wish to use, perform the calculation.
